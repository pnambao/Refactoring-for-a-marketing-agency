# Refactoring-for-a-marketing-agency
Improved code for a marketing agency to make website more accessible to people with disabilities.
​
## Description 
​
Refactoring is one of the tasks handed to junior developers, hence, this task helps to develop problem-solving and troubleshooting skills for beginner coders.
The client (Horiseon marketing agency) asked for a codebase that follows accessibility standards, so that their site is optimized for search engines.
I declattered the CSS code for the page,
added 'alt' attributes(so that images on the page would be accessible to people with disabilities), 
and included some semantic tags in the html file to improve search engine optimization. 
The image below is a preview of the web page:
